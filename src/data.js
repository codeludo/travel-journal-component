My 11yo and I even biked from the very top of the mountain. You CAN do it! With this adventure, you get breathtaking vistas, traversing unthinkable passes, biking passed grazing deer, tons of turns and thrills, and a boost of self-confidence when you're done for the day.  Can't wait to do it again next year. ðŸ¤˜",

Even if the journey is long for you (40 hours for me to get here from Florida) it is worthwhile getting to see this fantastic structure. I highly recommend you pay for a guided tour as it will be educational and efficient",

I'd highly recommend getting tickets in advance to avoid the lines as well as wearing light clothing that covers your arms and legs to protect from both the sun and insects. Don't forget a wide brimmed hat, but you can get one on the way!",
